[Alan Mathison Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was one of the pioneers in today's technology. He had some key contributions in breaking the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) during the World War II, which had a huge impact on the result of World War II. He also [pioneered the work in Artificial Intelligence](http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-18475646) (even before the term Artificial Intelligence was established), where he was the first one to discuss the ways of replicating human brain inside of a machine. His papers remain relevant today in this field, 60 years after they were published. [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) (a test which is used to determine is a machine intelligence really indistinguishable from human intelligence) was named after him.

He was sentenced to hormonal therapy because he was convicted as a homosexual (something that was illegal back then in the UK). He died two years later. Even though it was believed that he had committed suicide, Jack Copeland (the author of a book I will mention later) [is not so sure](http://m.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18561092).

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an [official public apology](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown/6170112/Gordon-Brown-Im-proud-to-say-sorry-to-a-real-war-hero.html) to Alan Turing on behalf of the British government in 2009. Queen Elizabeth granted him a [posthumous pardon](http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf) in 2013.

## Movies

The movie [The Imitation Game (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/) tried to show Turing's contributions during the World War II. It received an  Oscar award for the Best Writing Adapted Screenplay in the [87th Academy Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards). The movie has some controversy attached to his historical accuracy, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Controversy) and [here](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/).

## Is Turing Test Passed?

No.

Even though large news sources claim that the Turing test was passed for the first time by [Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman) (a chatbot made specifically to pass the Turing test), the replication of the test is considered far from the real Turing test. More on this controversy can be found [here](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml).
